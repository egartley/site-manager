# Site Manager
Desktop application used for management and upkeep of <a href="https://egartley.net/?via=sitemanagergithubreadme">egartley.net</a>

Rather than dynamically generating a page's content at each visit, static HTML is generated all at once for each page. This results in faster load times, by reducing both the server-side and client-side loads.
