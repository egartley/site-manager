# Site Manager
UWP application, written in C#, used for generating static HTML for <a href="https://egartley.net/?via=sitemanagergithubreadme">egartley.net</a>.

The actual implementation can be found <a href="https://github.com/egartley/site-manager/blob/master/HTMLBuilder.cs">here</a>. There is also capability for uploading the HTML files directly through an FTP/SFTP connection, but this is not currently be used.

Similarly with the ability to create, edit and remove redirections (go.egartley.net), that too is not functional at the moment.

"Core modules" are the things (pieces of code) that are constant across all pages, such as the sidebar and footer.
